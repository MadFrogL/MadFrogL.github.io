Hi, I'm a Research Fellow at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing). My supervisor is respected Professor [Jun Luo](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01107), and my current research interests include wireless sensing, machine learning, and signal processing. I have also conducted research in the fields of acoustics and vibration analysis.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Power Machinery and Engineering from the [State Key Laboratory of Engines](https://www.tju.edu.cn/info/1058/1442.htm) at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/) in 2022. I know my Ph.D. might seem unrelated to computer science, but my research focused on noise and vibration signal processing, which gave me a lot of freedom to explore and innovate.

Before joining NTU, I briefly worked for six months at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Intelligent Automotive Solution Business Unit, and interned for three months at China-Singapore International Joint Research Institute, AIWiSe Ltd. Inc.
